      <p class="w-[50%]">
        I'm a Singaporean studying game development. I started this journey because of games like League of Legends and Roblox,
        and now I have 3+ years of experience developing using a variety of tools, with my favourite being unity.
        <br><br>
        My main interest is in gameplay programming. 
        What I enjoy most about game development is not necessarily in seeing the final product but the journey to it; 
        figuring out how to structure and develop a codebase for a game is interesting, while
        learning and using new coding techniques and syntax is exciting.
